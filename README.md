# Task-Fragmentation-UI
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragmentation of UI (User Interface)

# My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that
fragmenting the UI into selective components offers numerous benefits in terms of readability, maintainability, reusability, scalability, and testability. By adopting a modular approach to UI development, we can create cleaner, more organized codebases that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time.

#### Justification for Fragmentation:
###### Readability: 
Fragmenting the UI into smaller, focused components improves readability by breaking down complex UI structures into simpler, more manageable parts.

###### Maintainability: 
By dividing the UI into reusable components, we promote code reusability and maintainability. Changes or updates to a specific section of the UI can be made more efficiently without affecting other parts of the application. This modular approach also facilitates easier debugging and troubleshooting.

###### Reusability: 
Fragmented components can be reused across different parts of the application, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy. Components like buttons, input fields, and transaction tables can be reused in multiple places, saving development time and effort.

###### Scalability: 
As the project grows in complexity, fragmented components provide a scalable foundation for adding new features or modifying existing ones. Developers can easily integrate new components or modify existing ones without introducing unnecessary dependencies or complexity.

###### Testability: 
Smaller, focused components are easier to test in isolation, leading to improved test coverage and more robust code. Unit tests can be written for individual components, ensuring that each piece of functionality behaves as expected.
